			<p class="intro">A food swamp is a community that is oversaturated with unhealthy food options. It's a place where finding accessible, fresh and healthy food can often be a physical and economical struggle. East New York is one such place.
			</p>
			<p>
			Residents of the Brooklyn neighborhood are suffering from elevated rates of nutrition-related illnesses such as obesity, hypertension and diabetes. According to the Community District Board, city efforts to bring more grocery stores, healthier bodega options, and better nutritional education to communities in need have been largely unsuccessful.

					<h4>Obesity</h4>

					<figcaption class="graphic-text">35% of East New York & Starrett City adults are obese, compared to 27% in Brooklyn and 24% in New York City. According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/effects/index.html">the CDC</a>, obesity increases a person's risk of other serious illnesses such as coronary heart disease, stroke, gallbladder disease and cancer, among others. Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher.

					<h4>Fast Food Proliferation</h4>

					<figcaption class="graphic-text">In 2014, the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/epi/databrief80.pdf">New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene</a> found that, for every grocery store in the East New York zip code 11208, there are five fast food restaurants. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/NYCPlanning/labs-cd-needs-statements/raw/master//BK%20DNS%20FY%202023/FY2023_Statement_BK05.pdf">Community District Board</a> says "the obvious injustice lies in the fact that these fast-food conglomerates are all within a mile of three NYCHA developments housing over 3500 families, two senior centers, four youth community centers, and three schools."</figcaption>

		<p class="intro">East New York resident Sharon Pitman, 58, has to take a cab to the nearest ShopRite to get anything fresh, despite living down the street from a bodega that should be stocking plenty of healthy food choices because it is part of the Shop Healthy NYC! Program that was started by the department of Health and Mental Hygiene in 2012.</p>

		<p>When asked what the grocery shopping experience is like for her, Pitman replied in one emphatic word: "Expensive."</p>

		<p>Shevanne Blake, 18, who lives in East New York and works at a local farmer's market, said he ate a lot of fast food growing up but realized all the problems it causes. "I saw a lot more junk food than actual vegetables... Every now and then you turn around and there's a new fast food area here," he said.</p>

		<p>Blake said inflated prices are pushing people to buy cheap fast food, and that the produce available in supermarkets and bodegas is often moldy. "People don't know where to look" for fresh produce in his neighborhood, he said.</p>
